==Create a file "~/myshare", and grant everyone read-write access.==

> Test whether you have correctly set permissions.

==Create "mygroupshare", grant only read access to everyone in your group.==

> Test whether you have correctly set permissions.

Create a new group called "staff", and create a file that you and the other user can collaborate on (both edit).

> Hint, you should both be added to the group. You may require root access for this task. Your classmate may want to ssh to your system.
>
> Test whether you have correctly set permissions. Both users should be able to edit the file, yet other users should not have write access.

Read and write to the shared files created by others, for example:

```bash
cat /home/*dropbear*/myshare
```

**Challenge**:

```bash
mkdir test
```

```bash
touch test/test1 test/test2 test/test3
```

> Use a single chmod command to recursively set the permissions for all files contained in the new "test" directory.
>
> Hint: `man chmod`
