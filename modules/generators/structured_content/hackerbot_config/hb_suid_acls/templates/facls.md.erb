## Linux Extended ACLs

We have explored standard Unix permissions. Modern Linux systems (and some other Unix-based systems) now have more complete (and complicated) ACL support.

As previously mentioned, an *access control list (ACL)* is attached to an object (resource) and lists all the subjects (users / active entities) that are allowed access, along with the kind of access that is authorised.

Set a file ACL on your mysecrets file, using the setfacl command:

```bash
setfacl -m u:student:r ~/mysecrets
```

This grants the "student" user read access to the file.

Note that the stat program is not usually ACL aware, so won't report anything out of the usual:

```bash
stat ~/mysecrets
```

The ls program can be used to detect File ACLs:

```bash
ls -la ~/mysecrets
```

`-rw-r-----+ 1 cliffe users 22 Feb 28 11:47 mysecrets`

Note that the output includes a `+`. This indicates an ACL is in place.

Use getfacl to display the permissions:

```bash
getfacl ~/mysecrets
```

Use Linux File ACLs to grant one or more specific users (other class members) read access to your mysecrets file.

Using ACLs, grant any other group (you choose) read-write access to your mygroupshare file.

Remove the group permission you just added.

> Example: `setfacl -x g:staff file`
