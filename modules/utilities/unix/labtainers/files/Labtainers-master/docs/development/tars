Large compressible file sets, e.g., system programs with a lot of files, or 
big password crackign files, can be managed using lab directories ending in
"_tar".  for example trunk/labs/<labname>/m_tar might contain several large 
files.  These files are kept in svn as descrete files (the tar is not in svn).
The image build process will tar (and compress) all such files into 
a "m_tar.tar"  The designer must direct the Dockerfile to "Add" this file
to the desired destination within the appropriate container.  (The name
of the tar directory has no semantics beyond selecting the name of the
tar file and directing the build to tar its content.)  The build function
WILL DELETE any .tar files in such directores before performing the tar.

The mkdist function will create a tar, but will also remove all other files
from its temporary copy of the _tar directory.  In other words, only tar files
will appear in the distribution tar.  NOTE: this makes a "rebuild" of a
distributed repo precarious.  As such, the build function will not do anything
if the only file in a _tar directory is the tarball.

The home_tar directory has distinct semantics.  Files that originate from
there will not be collected in studnet artifacts SO DO NOT PUT modifiable files
there if you student mods are graded or germane to the lab.  A home_tar.list
file is created in config & referenced when zipping up home.
