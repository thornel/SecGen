README for Labtainers testsets directory

labs -- the labs directory contains the regression test 'GOLD' files for each lab in the directory.
        Run the regression test from the labtainer-instructor directory,
        by invoking regresstest.py script

validate -- the validate directory contains the validation testing for the 'configuration' files
            (i.e., goals.config, results.config and parameter.config)
            Run the configuration file validation test from the labtainer-instructor directory,
            by invoking configtest.py script

watermark -- the watermark directory contains the watermark testing only
             Run the watermark test from the labtainer-instructor directory,
             by invoking the watermarktest.py script

simlab -- Lab performance simulation using the SimLab tool.  Requires installation of the xdotool.
           SimLab consumes files named:
           testsets/simlab/[lab]/simthis.txt , having a format of:
               window <name> 
                  Select the window whose title matches the given name, e.g., ubuntu@onewayhash
               type_file <fname>
                  Type lines from the fname file as if they were commands
               key "<key>"
                  Type the given key, identified by its X Keysim string.
               add_file <from> <to>
                  Add content of <from> to a file named <to>, creating if necessary
               replace_file <from> <to>
                  Replace the content of <to> with the content of <from>
                  
               sleep <seconds>
               wait_proc <proc string>
                  Wait until a "ps -ao <proc string>" finds no process on the linux host.
           The SimLab is intended to be run from the labtainer-student directory after the 
           lab has been started.  It is sensitive to the current window focus, so do not try
           to work in other windows.
           The smoketest.py utility will start a lab, run its SimLab, and then run the
           instructor container and compare results to what is found in the testsets/simlab/[lab]/expected 
           directory.
