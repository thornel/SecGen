# The PAM module can set the password crypt locally when changing the passwords, which is usually a good choice. Specifying something other than
# clear ensures that the password gets crypted in some way.
# 
# The meanings for selections are:
# 
# clear - Don't set any encryptions. This is useful with servers that automatically encrypt userPassword entry.
# 
# crypt - (Default) make userPassword use the same format as the flat filesystem. This will work for most configurations.
# 
# nds - Use Novell Directory Services-style updating by first removing the old password and then update with a cleartext password.
# 
# ad - Active Directory-style. Create a Unicode password and update the unicodePwd attribute.
# 
# exop - Use the OpenLDAP password change extended operation to update the password.
# 
# md5 - Use the stronger md5 algorithm instead of standard crypt.
# 
# (Choices: clear, crypt, nds, ad, exop, md5)
# Local crypt to use when changing passwords:
ldap-auth-config/pam_password="md5"

# The editor-based debconf frontend presents you with one or more text files to edit. This is one such text file. If you are familiar with standard
# unix configuration files, this file will look familiar to you -- it contains comments interspersed with configuration items. Edit the file,
# changing any items as necessary, and then save it and exit. At that point, debconf will read the edited file, and use the values you entered to
# configure the system.
