This lab illustrates a technique for parameterizing PCAP files by altering 
frame numbers associated with packets of interest.  This is acheived by
by using editcap to trim a random quanity of packets from the start of 
the student's PCAP file.

The lab requires the student to use tshark to analyze a PCAP file that was 
created using tcpdump to capture a telnet session.
The original PCAP file was constructed with a buffer of superfluous packets at
its beginning.  The fixlocal script invokes editcap to truncate the start of the 
PCAP file, passing the START_FRAME value which is parameterized to a random value.

To complete the lab, the student is directed to use a "frame.number==" filter to 
view a specific packet of interest, i.e., the packet containing an invalid password attempt.

On the grading side, the adjustframe.py script is invoked in the goals.config to adjust
original frame number to match the student's file.

The lab also parameterizes the timestamps within the PCAP file, though those are
not refrenced by grading.
