Title: HTTP Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise explores the use of wget
from a client computer to retrieve file content
from a server.
It is primarily to test artifacts in service logs.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    labtainer httplab

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions, a terminal connected to a client,
and a terminal connected to a server.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks
3.1. Use 'wget' to get files from HTTP server

Use ifconfig on the server computer to find its ip address.
There are pre-created files 'index.html', 'link1.html' and 'link2.html'

Use 'wget' to get files 'http://<IPADDr>/index.html


4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stoplab httplab

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stoplab
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
