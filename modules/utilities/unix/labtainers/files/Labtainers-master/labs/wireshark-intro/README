This lab illustrates a technique for parameterizing PCAP files by altering 
time associated with packets captured. This is achived by using editcap
to add a random number of seconds to the start time of the student's PCAP file.
The parameterized the timestamps within the PCAP file are referenced for grading implicitly
(checksum will not match if student copy the saved frame packet from another student).

The lab requires the student to use wireshark to analyze a PCAP file that was 
created using tcpdump to capture a telnet session.
The original PCAP file was constructed with a buffer of superfluous packets at
its beginning. The student will learn how to use wireshark to analyze packet
by looking for a specific telnet packet where the 'john-password' is passed in the clear.
The student will save that specific frame/packet as invalidpassword.pcap file.

The student is considered to have completed the lab successfully if the correct packet
is captured.

On the grading side, the pregrade.sh script is used to extract the correct frame/packet
and save as expected answer.

To evaluate the student's task is completed or not, the checksum is computed for
the student's saved packet against the expected answer. The goal is achieved is both
checksums are the same.
