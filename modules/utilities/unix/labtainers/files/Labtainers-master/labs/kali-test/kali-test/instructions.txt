This is not a lab exercise, it is an example of running a Kali Linux
system and a Metasploitable host.  It is also and example of using
MACVLANs to enable networking between containers and external hosts,
e.g., a Windows VM.  This lab assumes you have defined a host-only
network on the host that is running a VMM, e.g., VirtualBox, assigned
that network an IP address on the VM running Labtainers, and enabled 
promiscuous mode for that interface in both the VMM and on the 
Labtainers VM.  You should then be able to spin up an external VM,
e.g., Windows, assign it an address on that same subnet, and communicate
with it.

The username for the kali systems is "ubuntu".  The password is "studentN" where
N is the instance number of the kali client.  This lab also illustrates the
use of CLONES.

See the Lab Designer's User Guide for details.
