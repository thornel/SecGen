This document explains how the CHLICSA scenario attacking machine is configured
and how it executes the attacks. 

1. Auto-login
Because this machine is unmanned, yet several attacks called require a UI 
(e.g., browser window), this machine auto logs in. 

  /etc/profile.d/pyserver.sh 
  This shell script calls the main attack file: /root/Desktop/attacks/main2.py


	



This is the directory with all of the attacks and files needed for the attacks

***Notes

*To run all the attacks simply run main.py
	*to add attacks change main.py

*Proxychains.conf should be in the /etc directory

*https-ftp uses the commands from ftpcommands.txt

*To get the socks proxy up start ssh and run:
	*ssh -NfD 9050 root@localhost

*To run the loginssh.py file you need the pxssh module
	*run 'pip install pxssh' or 'pip install pexpect'

*MITM attacks require ettecap

*Scans.py requires nmap

*ftpbrute.py and sshbrute.py require hydra

*Also getip.py and main.py require the netifaces module
	*run 'pip install netifaces'
