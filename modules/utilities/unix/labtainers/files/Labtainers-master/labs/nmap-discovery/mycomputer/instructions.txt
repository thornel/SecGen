Title: Nmap Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise explores Nmap.

2. Performing the lab

The lab is started from the Labtainer working directory on your 
Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.  From there, issue the command:

	labtainer nmap-discovery

The resulting virtual terminals will include a display of these 
instructions, and bash shell. Nmap is pre-installed on the container.

To navigate these instructions, use the arrow keys along with the 
Space/Home/End/Page Up/Page Down keys. To exit these instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks

Your boss wants you to prepare for a meeting on a project you have not 
worked on for months. You have a summary file on the "friedshrimp" 
server that you previously accessed via ssh. You cannot remember the 
IP address of friedshrimp, and you forgot which port the IT staff 
assigned for SSH on that server, though you think it is between
2000 and 3000. You do know that your password is the 
usual one used in these labs. Use nmap to find the IP address and port number
used by the SSH service. Then review the content of "friedshrimp.txt" file
from an SSH session.

If you need help with nmap commands, you can use the "man nmap" command to 
view the manual.  And note that to ssh to a host via a port other than the
default, use "ssh -p <port> <host>".

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

	stoplab nmap-discovery

from the host Labtainer working directory. You can always restart the 
Labtainer to continue your work. When the Labtainer is stopped, a zip 
file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stoplab command. 
When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
