Title: VPN Lab Exercise (host-to-gateway VPN)

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise illustrates a simple
host-to-gateway vpn implemented with openvpn, and
a static shared key.

The example network is identical to that in
the "host-to-host VPN" lab exercise, except
there is now gateway in front of the server.
As with the previous exercise, the server
offers a simple HTTP service,  and the student
will use wget on the client to retrieve html
files from the server.

The openvpn application is pre-installed
on the client and the gateway, and the
corresponding openvpn configuration files
already exist.  To create an encrypted tunnel,
the student only has to execute openvpn on
the client and the gateway.

In this exercise, the student will observe
that the client is unable to reach the server
until the openvpn tunnel is established. And,
use of the gateway allows the client to name 
the server using the server's network address
rather than the network address associated with
the tunnel as was required in the host-to-host 
VPN lab exercise.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Docker-enabled host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    labtainer vpnlab

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions, a terminal connected to a client,
and a terminal connected to a server.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks
3.1 Use tcpdump on the router to display network traffic:
    sudo tcpdump -n -XX -i eth0

3.2 Use wget on the client to fetch the index.html file
    wget  http://<IPADDr>/index.html
Where <IPADDR> is the server network address, which you
can learn by running "ifconfig" on the server.

Observe that wget fails.  Use "<ctrl> c" to exit wget.

3.3 Start the openvpn program on the gateway:
sudo openvpn --config gateway.conf --daemon

3.4 Start the openvpn program on the client:
sudo  openvpn --config client.conf --daemon

3.5 Use wget again, just as was done previously.
Note the wget succeeds this time.
Note you are using the server's network address
rather than the address associated with an encrypted tunnel.
Observe the network traffic in tcpdump.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stoplab httplab

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stoplab
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
