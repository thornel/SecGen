'''
This python script represents the physical system.  It interacts with
the PLC via shared memory.  The physical system has two active attributes.
The first is a source of water flowing into a resevoir at a rate that
varies over time.  The second is an outflow drain pump that is either on or off, 
controlled by the PLC. When open, the pump removes 2 vertical feet per day
from the resevior.  Everything
is measured in feet per day, and there is one day of simulated time per second
of real time.
 
Shared memory represents an I/O device connecting the simulated PLC to the physical
system. The first 32-bit int represents the current water level, and is written by a physical 
system monitor to shared memory.  The second 32-bit int 
is an input from the PLC, which is true if the pump is running, false if closed.
