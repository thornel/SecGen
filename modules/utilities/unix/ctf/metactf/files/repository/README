This is the source code for the reverse engineering CTFs used at
Portland State University within our Computer Systems Programming
course and our Malware Reverse Engineering Course.

etc -> configuration required to run on nginx or Apache wsgi
src_malware -> source code for Malware (CS 492/592) levels
src_csp -> source code for Computer Systems Programming (CS 201) levels
src_angr -> source code for Angr (CS 492/592) levels (see below)
www -> web site
install.sh -> install script for nginx on Ubuntu 18.04
   git clone .../metactf
   mv metactf foo
   cd foo
   git submodule init     (For src_angr)
   git submodule update
   sudo ./install.sh foo.oregonctf.org

MetaCTF comes with the source for the both the Malware and Computer Systems
Programming CTF.  Installation for each is identical.  Simply change
directories to the CTF you want to run and follow the build instructions.
Both CTFs use the same web site code.

To build the source for the CTF you wish to run, change into its directory
and edit the userlist in users to create your list of users and their
passwords (space-delimited).
	make distclean
		- whack prior builds if applicable
	make
		- builds per-user binaries for all levels in all SUBDIRS
	make <SUBDIR>
		- builds per-user binaries for levels in SUBDIR
	make install
		- installs all built binaries into web directory
		- creates www logins in www/users.py (via wwwusers target)
        sudo systemctl restart foo

If a "Bad Gateway" error is returned through nginx, debug the web app via
        $PATH/env/bin/uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:5000 --protocol=http -w wsgi:app

Adding new users to site while saving the old.
	Move the login information from users file into "saved_users"
	Edit users file to specify new users
	Build the binaries for the new users and install
	Updates www logins to include both users and saved_users (via wwwusers
		target)
	Combine both users file into a single users file, clear out saved_users

Making changes to src_angr.
  The submodule src_angr references https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf
  On master in angr_ctf, make changes
  Checkout the cs492 branch and merge master into it
  In this repository, `cd angr_ctf; git pull origin cs492`
  To get latest angr_ctf changes
     git submodule update --remote --merge
